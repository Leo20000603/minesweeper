Minesweeper TODO
================

- Blink the "Restart" button
- Rename "Restart" to "New Game" or split to: "Easy" "Medium" and "Hard" buttons, with a "New Game" label before it
- Ability to drag a flag onto a mine, as well as have it toggle "flag mode"
- Background and cell colors change to green when in "flag mode" (note: it's yellow now, not green)
